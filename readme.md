## README: AI Customer Support Bot project for Headstarter week 3

### Overview
This project implements an AI-powered customer support bot using React, HTML, CSS, Python, Langchain, and Groq. The bot provides a user interface for interacting with the AI model and displays the generated responses.

### Prerequisites
* Python (version 3.6 or later)
* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* pip (Python package installer)
* Required Python libraries: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Langchain, Groq
* Basic understanding of Python, React, HTML, and CSS

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khavindev/AI-Customer-Support
   ```
2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain groq
   ```
3. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
#### Backend
1. **Start the Python backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the FastAPI application, serving the API at http://localhost:8000.

#### Frontend
1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   python -m http.server 8080 //pass it to server
   npm start
   ```
   This will start a development server and open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:8000.

### How it Works
* The frontend (React, HTML, CSS) provides a user interface with a search form.
* User input is sent to the backend (Python, FastAPI) as an API request.
* The backend processes the query using Langchain and Groq, generating a response.
* The response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.
* The bot gets information from prompt.txt and gives output accordingly

### Additional Notes
* Replace `main` in the `uvicorn` command with the actual name of your Python file.
* Customize the HTML, CSS, and React components to match your desired user interface.
* Fine-tune the Langchain and Groq models for optimal performance.
* Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys.
* Implement error handling and logging for better debugging and monitoring.
* Change the prompt.txt with your own

### Potential Improvements
* Add support for multiple languages.
* Integrate with a speech-to-text and text-to-speech engine for voice interaction.
* Deploy the application to a cloud platform for wider accessibility.
* Implement user authentication and authorization.
* Collect user feedback and analytics to improve the bot's performance.

By following these steps and considering the potential improvements, you can create a robust and effective AI customer support bot.
 
**Remember to replace placeholders like `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with actual values.**
